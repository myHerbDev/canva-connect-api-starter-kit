# This workflow will trigger Datadog Synthetic tests within your Datadog organisation
# For more information on running Synthetic tests within your GitHub workflows see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/cicd_integrations/github_actions/

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# To get started:

# 1. Add your Datadog API (DD_API_KEY) and Application Key (DD_APP_KEY) as secrets to your GitHub repository. For more information, see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/.
# 2. Start using the action within your workflow
            - name: Setup .NET Core SDK
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4.1.0
  with:
    # Optional SDK version(s) to use. If not provided, will install global.json version when available. Examples: 2.2.104, 3.1, 3.1.x, 3.x, 6.0.2xx
    dotnet-version: # optional
    # Optional quality of the build. The possible values are: daily, signed, validated, preview, ga.
    dotnet-quality: # optional
    # Optional global.json location, if your global.json isn't located in the root of the repo.
    global-json-file: # optional
    # Optional package source for which to set up authentication. Will consult any existing NuGet.config in the root of the repo and provide a temporary NuGet.config using the NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable as a ClearTextPassword
    source-url: # optional
    # Optional OWNER for using packages from GitHub Package Registry organizations/users other than the current repository's owner. Only used if a GPR URL is also provided in source-url
    owner: # optional
    # Optional NuGet.config location, if your NuGet.config isn't located in the root of the repo.
    config-file: # optional
    # Optional input to enable caching of the NuGet global-packages folder
    cache: # optional
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: packages.lock.json. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
          
            - name: Setup Node.js environment
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4.1.0
  with:
    # Set always-auth in npmrc.
    always-auth: # optional, default is false
    # Version Spec of the version to use. Examples: 12.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0.
    node-version: # optional
    # File containing the version Spec of the version to use.  Examples: package.json, .nvmrc, .node-version, .tool-versions.
    node-version-file: # optional
    # Target architecture for Node to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
    architecture: # optional
    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec.
    check-latest: # optional
    # Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc and .yarnrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.
    registry-url: # optional
    # Optional scope for authenticating against scoped registries. Will fall back to the repository owner when using the GitHub Packages registry (https://npm.pkg.github.com/).
    scope: # optional
    # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm.
    cache: # optional
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
                      - name: Upload a Build Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4.4.3
  with:
    # Artifact name
    name: # optional, default is artifact
    # A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload
    path: 
    # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
    # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.

    include-hidden-files: # optional, default is false
